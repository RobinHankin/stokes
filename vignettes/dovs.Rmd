```{r}
dovs
```

Function `dovs()` returns the dimensionality of the underlying vector
space of a $k$-form.  Recall that a $k$-form is an alternating linear
map from $V^k$ to $\mathbb{R}$, where $V=\mathbb{R}^n$.  Function
`dovs()` returns $n$.  The function is, as seen above, very simple but
its use is not entirely straightforward in the context of `stokes`
idiom.

Consider the following:


```{r}
set.seed(0)
a <- rform(n=4,k=2)
a
```

Now object `a` is notionally a map from $\left(\mathbb{R}^4\right)^2$
to $\mathbb{R}$:

```{r}
f <- as.function(a)
(M <- matrix(1:8,4,2))
f(M)
```

However, `a` can equally be considered to be a map from
$\left(\mathbb{R}^5\right)^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$:


```{r}
f <- as.function(a)
(M <- matrix(1:10,5,2))
f(M)
```

If we view $a$ [or indeed `f()`] in this way, that is
$a\colon\left(\mathbb{R}^5\right)^2\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$, we
observe that $e_5$, that is $\left(0,0,0,0,1\right)^T$, maps to zero:

```{r}
(M <- cbind(c(0,0,0,0,1),runif(5)))
f(M)
```

(and of course, because `a` is alternating, we could have put $e_5$ in
the second column with the same result).  The $k$form `a` returns zero
because the index matrix of `a` does not include the number 5.

Most of the time, this does not matter.  However, consider this:

```{r}
dx
```

Now, _we_ know that `dx` is supposed to be a map from
$\left(\mathbb{R}^3\right)^1$ to $\mathbb{R}$; but:

```{r}
dovs(dx)
```

So according to `stokes`,
$\operatorname{dx}\colon\left(\mathbb{R}^1\right)^1\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$.
This does not really matter numerically, until we consider the Hodge
star operator.  We know that
$\star\operatorname{dx}=\operatorname{dy}\wedge\operatorname{dz}$, but

```{r}
hodge(dx)
```

R gives, correctly, that the Hodge star of $\operatorname{dx}$ is the
zero-dimensional volume element (otherwise known as ''1'').  To get
the right answer, we need to specify `dovs` explicitly:


```{r}
hodge(dx,3)
```

Actually this looks a lot better with a more appropriate print method:

```{r}
options(kform_symbolic_print="dx")
hodge(dx,3)
```
