# The vector cross product

@spivak1965, p83, considers the standard vector cross product
$\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}=\det\begin{pmatrix} i & j & k \\
u_1&u_2&u_3\\ v_1&v_2&v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and places it in a more
general and rigorous context.  In a memorable passage, he states:

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#E9D8FD; color:#69337A'>
<span>
<p>

If $v_1,\ldots,v_{n-1}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\phi$ is defined by

$$
\phi(w)=\det\left(\begin{array}{c}v_1\\ \vdots\\ v_{n-1}\\w\end{array}\right)
$$

then $\phi\in\Lambda^1\left(\mathbb{R}^n\right)$; therefore there is a
unique $z\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that

$$
\left\langle w,z\right\rangle=\phi(w)=
\det\left(\begin{array}{c}v_1\\ \vdots\\ v_{n-1}\\w\end{array}\right).
$$	

This $z$ is denoted $v_1\times\ldots\times v_{n-1}$ and is called the
*cross product* of $v_1,\ldots,v_{n-1}$.

</p></span>
</div>

The reason that $\mathbf{w}$ is at the bottom rather than the top is
that it ensures that the the $n$-tuple
$(\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_{n-1},\mathbf{w})$ has positive
orientation with respect to the standard basis vectors of
$\mathbb{R}^n$.  In $\mathbb{R}^3$ we get the standard elementary
mnemonic for $\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2,u_3)$, $\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2,v_3)$:

\[
\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}=
\mathrm{det}
\begin{pmatrix}
i&j&k\\
u_1&u_2&u_3\\
v_1&v_2&v_3
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

This is (universal) shorthand for the formal definition of the cross
product, although sometimes it is better to return to Spivak's
formulation and, writing $\mathbf{w}=(w_1,w_2,w_3)$, use the
definition directly obtaining

\[
(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{w}=
\mathrm{det}
\begin{pmatrix}
w_1&w_2&w_3\\
u_1&u_2&u_3\\
v_1&v_2&v_3
\end{pmatrix}.
\]


## R implementation {-}

In the package [@hankin2022_stokes], R function
`vector_cross_product()` takes a matrix with $n$ rows and $n-1$
columns: the transpose of the work above.  This is because `stokes`
(and `R`) convention is to interpret _columns_ of a matrix as vectors.
If we wanted to take the cross product of $\mathbf{u}=(5,-2,1)$ with
$\mathbf{v}=(1,2,0)$:

```{r}
(M <- cbind(c(5,-2,1),c(1,2,0)))
vector_cross_product(M)
```

But of course we can work with higher dimensional spaces:

```{r}
vector_cross_product(matrix(rnorm(30),6,5))
```

# Verification

## Orientation

We can demonstrate that the function has the correct orientation.  We
need to ensure that the vectors
$\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_n,\mathbf{v}_1\times\cdots\times\mathbf{v}_n$
constitute a right-handed basis:

```{r}
det(cbind(M,vector_cross_product(M)))>0
```

So it is right-handed in this case.  Here is a more severe test of the
right-handedness::

```{r}
f <- function(n){
  M <- matrix(rnorm(n^2+n),n+1,n)
  det(cbind(M,vector_cross_product(M)))>0
}

all(sapply(sample(3:10,100,replace=TRUE),f))
```

Above, we see that in each case the vectors are right-handed.  We may
further verify that the rules for determinants are being obeyed by
taking a dot product as follows:

```{r verifyalternatingproperty}
M <- matrix(rnorm(42),7,6)
crossprod(M,vector_cross_product(M))
```

Writing $M=[v_1,\ldots,v_6]$, $v_i\in\mathbb{R}^7$, we see that the
dot product $v_i\cdot v_1\times\cdots\times v_6$ as implemented by
`crossprod()` vanishes (up to numerical precision), as the
determinants in question have two identical columns.

## Immediate properties

Spivak gives the following properties:

\[
\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(1)}\times\cdots\times\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(n)} =
\operatorname{sgn}\sigma\cdot
\mathbf{v}_{1}\times\cdots\times\mathbf{v}_{n}
\]

\[
\mathbf{v}_{1}
\times\cdots\times
a\mathbf{v}_i
\times\cdots\times
\mathbf{v}_{n} =
a\cdot
\mathbf{v}_{1}
\times\cdots\times
\mathbf{v}_i
\times\cdots\times
\mathbf{v}_{n}
\]

\[
\mathbf{v}_{1}
\times\cdots\times
\left(\mathbf{v}_i+{\mathbf{v}'}_i\right)
\times\cdots\times
\mathbf{v}_{n} =
\mathbf{v}_{1}
\times\cdots\times
\mathbf{v}_i
\times\cdots\times
\mathbf{v}_{n}
+
\mathbf{v}_{1}
\times\cdots\times
{\mathbf{v}'}_i
\times\cdots\times
\mathbf{v}_{n}
\]

For the first we use a permutation `sigma` from the `permutations`
package [@hankin2020] with a sign of $-1$:

```{r verifyspivakfirst}
M <- matrix(rnorm(30),6,5)
sigma <- as.cycle("(12)(345)")
sgn(sigma)
Mdash <- M[,as.function(sigma)(seq_len(5))]
vector_cross_product(M) + vector_cross_product(Mdash)
```

Above we see that the the two vector cross products add to zero (up to
numerical precision), as they should because `sigma` is an odd
permutation.  For the second:

```{r verifyspivaksecond}
Mdash <- M
Mdash[,3] <- pi*Mdash[,3]
vector_cross_product(Mdash) - vector_cross_product(M) * pi
```

Above we see that the second product is $\pi$ times the first (to
numerical precision), by linearity of the vector cross product.  For
the third:

```{r verifyspivakthird}
M1 <- M
M2 <- M
Msum <- M
v1 <- runif(6)
v2 <- runif(6)
M1[,3] <- v1
M2[,3] <- v2
Msum[,3] <- v1+v2
vector_cross_product(M1) + vector_cross_product(M2) - vector_cross_product(Msum)
```

Above we see that the sum of the first two products is equal to that
of the third (up to numerical precision), again by linearity of the
vector cross product.


## Vector products and Hodge 

The cross product has a coordinate-free definition as the Hodge
conjugate of the wedge product of its arguments.  This is not used in
function `vector_cross_product()` because it is computationally
inefficient and (I think) prone to numerical roundoff errors.  We may
verify that the definitions agree, using a six-dimensional test case:

```{r}
set.seed(2)
M <- matrix(rnorm(30),6,5)
(ans1 <- vector_cross_product(M))
```

We can see that `vector_cross_product()` returns an R vector.  To
verify that this is correct, we compare the output with the value
calculated directly with the wedge product:

```{r}
(jj <- as.1form(M[,1]) ^ as.1form(M[,2]) ^ as.1form(M[,3]) ^ as.1form(M[,4]) ^ as.1form(M[,5]))
(ans2 <- hodge(jj))
```

Above we see agreement between `ans1` and `ans2` although the elements
might appear in a different order (as per disordR discipline).
Actually it is possible to produce the same answer using slightly
slicker idiom:

```{r}
(ans3 <- hodge(Reduce(`^`,lapply(1:5,function(i){as.1form(M[,i])}))))
```

[again note the different order in the output].  Above, we see that
the output of `vector_cross_product()` [`ans1`] is an ordinary R
vector, but the direct result [`ans2`] is a 1-form.  In order to
compare these, we first need to coerce `ans2` to a 1-form and then
subtract:

```{r}
(diff <- as.1form(ans1) - ans3)
coeffs(diff)
```

Above we see that `ans1` and `ans3` match to within numerical
precision.

##  Vector cross products in 3 dimensions

Taking Spivak's definition at face value, we could define the vector
cross product $\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}$ of three-vectors
$\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ as a map from the tangent space to the
reals, with $\left(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}\right)(\mathbf{w})=
\left(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}\right)\cdot\mathbf{w}
=\left(I_\mathbf{u}\right)_\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{w})$, where $I$ is the
3-volume element and subscripts refer to contraction.  Package idiom
for this would be:

```{r showalternativevcp,eval=FALSE}
function(u,v){contract(volume(3),cbind(u,v))}
```

However, note that 3D vector cross products are implemented in the
package as function `vcp3()`, which uses different idiom:

```{r showvcp3}
body(vcp3)
```   

This is preferable on the grounds that coercion to a 1-form is
explicit.  Suppose we wish to take the vector cross product of
$\mathbf{u}=\left(1,4,2\right)^T$ and
$\mathbf{v}=\left(2,1,5\right)^T$:

```{r label=definevcp}
u <- c(1,4,2)
v <- c(2,1,5)
(p <- vcp3(u,v))  # 'p' for (cross) product
```

Above, note the order of the lines is implementation-specific as per
`disordR` discipline [@hankin2022_disordR], but the form itself should
agree with basis vector evaluation given below.  Object `p` is the
vector cross product of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, but is given as
a one-form.  We can see the mnemonic in operation by coercing `p` to a
function and then evaluating this on the three basis vectors of
$\mathbb{R}^3$:

```{r label=ucvijk}
ucv  <- as.function(p)
c(i=ucv(ex), j=ucv(ey), k=ucv(ez))
```

and we see agreement with the mnemonic
$\det\begin{pmatrix}i&j&k\\1&4&2\\2&1&5\end{pmatrix}$.  Further, we
may evaluate the triple cross product
$(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{w}$ by evaluating `ucv()` at
$\mathbf{w}$.

```{r label=ucvw}
w <- c(1,-3,2)
ucv(w)
```

This shows agreement with the elementary mnemonic
$\det\begin{pmatrix}1&-3&2\\1&4&2\\2&1&5\end{pmatrix}=7$, as expected
from linearity.

## Vector cross product identities

The following identities are standard results:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{u}\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w}) &= \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{u})-\mathbf{w}(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v})\\
(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})\times\mathbf{w} &= \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{u})-\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{w})\\
(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})\times(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{w}) &= (\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w}))\mathbf{u}  \\
(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})\cdot(\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{x})  &= (\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{w})(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{x}) -
                                                                  (\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{x})(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{w})
\end{aligned}
$$

We may verify all four together:

```{r}
x <- c(-6,5,7)  # u,v,w as before
c(
  hodge(as.1form(u) ^ vcp3(v,w))        == as.1form(v*sum(w*u) - w*sum(u*v)),
  hodge(vcp3(u,v) ^ as.1form(w))        == as.1form(v*sum(w*u) - u*sum(v*w)),
  as.1form(as.function(vcp3(v,w))(u)*u) == hodge(vcp3(u,v) ^ vcp3(u,w))     ,
  hodge(hodge(vcp3(u,v)) ^ vcp3(w,x))   == sum(u*w)*sum(v*x) - sum(u*x)*sum(v*w)
)		  
```
