```{r}
dx <- d(1)
dy <- d(2)
dz <- d(3)
```

Convenience objects `dx`, `dy`, and `dz` are discussed here.  The
conjugate basis vectors `i`, `j` and `k` are discussed in `ijk.Rmd`.

Spivak, in a memorable passage, states (p89):

If $f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable,
then $Df(p)\in\Lambda^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$.  By a minor modification we
therefore obtain a $1$-form $df$, defined by

$$df(p)(v_p)=Df(p)(v).$$

Let us consider in particular the $1$-forms $d\pi^i$ ^[Spivak
introduces the $\pi^i$ notation on page 11: "if
$\pi\colon\mathbb{R}^n\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ is the identity
function, $\pi(x)=x$, then [its components are] $\pi^i(x)=x^i$; the
function $\pi^i$ is called the $i^\mathrm{th}$ *projection function*"]
It is customary to let $x^i$ denote the _function_ $\pi^i$ (on
$\mathbb{R}^3$ we often denote $x^1$, $x^2$, and $x^3$ by $x$, $y$,
and $z$) $\ldots$ Since
$dx^i(p)(v_p)=d\pi^i(p)(v_p)=D\pi^i(p)(v)=v^i$, we see that
$dx^1(p),\ldots,dx^n(p)$ is just the dual basis to $(e_1)_p,\ldots,
(e_n)_p$.

Spivak goes on to observe that every $k$-form $\omega$ can be written
$\omega=\sum_{i_1 < \cdots < i_k}\omega_{i_1,\ldots
i_k}dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}$.  If working in
$\mathbb{R}^3$, we have three elementary forms $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$;
in the package we have the pre-defined objects `dx`, `dy`, and `dz`.
These are convenient for reproducing textbook results.  We start with
some illustrations of the package print method.

```{r}
dx
```

This is somewhat opaque and difficult to understand.  It is easier to
start with a more complicated example: take $dx\wedge dy -7dx\wedge dz
+ 3dy\wedge dz$:

```{r}
dx^dy -7*dx^dz + 3*dy^dz
```

We see three rows for the three elementary components.  Taking the row
with coefficient $-7$ [which would be $-7dx\wedge dz$], this maps
$\left(\mathbb{R}^3\right)^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and we have

$$(-7dx\wedge dz)\left(\begin{pmatrix} u_1\\u_2\\u_3\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\v_3\end{pmatrix}\right)=
-7\det\begin{pmatrix}u_1&v_1\\u_3&v_3\end{pmatrix}$$

Armed with this familiar fact, we can interpret $dx$ as a map from
$\left(\mathbb{R}^3\right)^1$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with

$$dx\left(\begin{pmatrix} u_1\\u_2\\u_3\end{pmatrix}
\right)=
\det\begin{pmatrix}u_1\end{pmatrix}=u_1$$

or, in other words, $dx$ picks out the first component of its vector
(as the print method gives, albeit obscurely).  This is easily shown
in the package:

```{r coercedxtoafunction}
as.function(dx)(c(113,3,6))
```

We might want to verify that $dx\wedge dy=-dy\wedge dx$:

```{r dxdyequalsminusdydx}
dx ^ dy == -dy ^ dx
```

# Elementary forms and the print method

The print method is configurable and can display kforms in symbolic
form.  For working with `dx dy dz` we may set option
`kform_symbolic_print` to `dx`:

```{r setusedx}
options(kform_symbolic_print = 'dx')
```

Then the results of calculations are more natural:

```{r showdxwithusedx}
dx
dx^dy + 56*dy^dz
```

However, this setting can be confusing if we work with $dx^i,i>3$, for
the print method runs out of alphabet:

```{r runsoutofalphabet}
rform()
```

Above, we see the use of `NA` because there is no defined symbol.


## The Hodge dual

Function `hodge()` returns the Hodge dual:

```{r hodgedxdydz}
hodge(dx^dy + 13*dy^dz)
```

Note that calling `hodge(dx)` can be confusing:

```{r hodgedx}
hodge(dx)
```

This returns a scalar because `dx` is interpreted as a one-form on
one-dimensional space, which is a scalar form.  One usually wants the
result in three dimensions:

```{r hodgedx3}
hodge(dx,3)
```

This is further discussed in the `dovs` vignette.

## Other ways to create the elementary one-forms

It is possible to create these objects using package idiom:

```{r}
d(1) == dx
```

## Basis vectors 


### Package dataset

Following lines create `dx.rda`, residing in the `data/` directory of
the package.

```{r,label=savedxdydz}
save(dx,dy,dz,file="dx.rda")
```
