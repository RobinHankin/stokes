Description: Provides functionality for working with differentials,
           k-forms, wedge products, Stokes's theorem, and related concepts
	   from the exterior calculus.  Functionality for Grassman algebra
	   is provided.  The canonical reference would be:
	   M. Spivak (1965, ISBN:0-8053-9021-9) "Calculus on Manifolds".
	   The 'stokes' package was formerly known as the 'wedge' package.
